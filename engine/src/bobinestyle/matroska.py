"""Just enough of Matroska's structure to check a written file's clusters.

Players read a Matroska file cluster by cluster, in file order: a cluster
whose timestamp is earlier than the one before it holds blocks a player
like VLC considers already played, and skips (see mux.verify). Only the
element headers are read, each cluster's content skipped: a whole film is
checked in a fraction of a second.
